# GilGoblin

## Summary

`GilGoblin` is a end-to-end application which calculates in-game crafting profitability in Final Fantasy XIV (FFXIV). 

It calculates the most profitable items to craft based on current market prices, vendor prices and crafting component costs. It stores recent prices in a local PostgreSQL database. The prices are refreshed by a background service.

A webpage front-end is available with the resulting calculations. Filters are available per world, allowing users to see the most profitable items specific to their server.

## Technologies
* The back-end REST API is written in C# (.NET 8)
* The back-end tests use NUnit and NSubstitute
* The front-end uses React, written in Typescript
* The front-end tests use Jest
* There are 5 Docker images (listed below) specific to GilGoblin
* K6 benchmarks can be optionally run.
  * Results are fed to Prometheus.
  * Test results are displayed in a Grafana dashboard

## Startup
From the root folder of the project, run `docker-compose up -d` to build the images. The database will load, and if necessary run the scripts to populate the tables. The front end is available by default over port 3000. The other services will run in the background periodically to refresh data.

The docker containers need to be running and healthy for the component tests to pass.
