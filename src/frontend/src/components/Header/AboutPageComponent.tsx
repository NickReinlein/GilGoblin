                <code>GilGoblin</code> is a project designed to calculate in-game crafting profitability in
                <a href="https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/"> Final Fantasy XIV (FFXIV)</a>, and display a result for
                users sorted by profitability.<br/><br/>
                It determines the most profitable items to craft based on current market prices, vendor prices, and
                crafting component costs.<br/><br/>
                Recent prices are stored in a local PostgresSQL database, which is refreshed by a background service.
                This keeps profits relevant with up-to-date data.<br/><br/>
